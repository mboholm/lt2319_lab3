# Lab 3: Instructional dialogue

## On empty turns in tests
Four tests (excluding "main menu") are defined in `lt2319_lab3/ddds/lab3_cooking_app/test/interaction_tests_eng.txt`, which test the functionality required to be implemented in #1-3. In both test "French omelette with user question" and that of "French omelette with help" there are empty turns. These empty turns might seem a bit *ad hoc* solutions to pass the tests. Indeed, they are, but I have not further explored the possibilites of implementing a systems than would pass tests without such empty turns.
